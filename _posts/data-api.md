post_intro: <p><a href="http://wistia.com">Wistia</a> is a video hosting solution for marketers.  We make it easy to upload, manage, share, and track your web video performance.</p><p>The Wistia data API gives you all kinds of programmatic access to your Wistia account. The data is available in either JSON or XML format over HTTP.</p><p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/wistia/wistia-api" target="_blank">Wistia API Ruby gem</a> for integrating into your application.</p>

## Getting Started

#### Creating and Managing Access Tokens

When your Wistia account is created, a master token will automatically be geneated for you account, which you can find in the _API Access_ area of your [_Account Dashboard_](../doc/account-setup). This master token has full read/write permissions on your account. You can generate additional access tokens with various permissions right there as well. Huzzah!

#### Versions and Updates

We will introduce API changes when necessary/possible, and update the version
number (i.e. *v1*) when a **breaking change** is made.

#### Resources

To make your Wistia experience even more awesome, here are some resources just for you:

## Making Requests

### Authentication

You must use **SSL** (https instead of http) to access the API.

There are two ways to authenticate when accessing the API:

1. **HTTP Basic authentication** with `api` as your username and your API password as the password.
2. Add `api_password` as a parameter when making a request. For example:

<code class="full_width">https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias.json?api_password=xyz123</code>

### Passing Parameters

All parameters should be passed in the body of the request and URL encoded.
Alternatively, they can be appended to the end of the URL after a question mark
(?) character and passed as query string parameters.

### Response Formats

The request examples retrieve the data in **JSON** format. If you would like
the data in **XML** format, change the extension of the request from `json` to
`xml`.

### PUT and DELETE

Some HTTP clients are limited to sending `GET` and `POST` requests (e.g. HTML
forms have this limitation).  You will notice, however, that many of the API
calls only respond to `PUT` or `DELETE` requests.  In order to trigger these
calls from a client that does not support `PUT` or `DELETE`, use a POST request
and add a parameter named “\_method” (no quotes) with a value of either `put`
or `delete`.

### Rate Limit

The API has a rate limit at 100 requests per minute.  If there are more than
100 requests in a minute for a particular account, the service will respond
with HTTP `error 503 Service Unavailable` and the Retry-After HTTP header will
be set with a number of seconds to wait before trying again.


## Paging and Sorting Responses

The *list* methods in the API support paging, sorting, and filtering of
results. Filtering will be covered in the individual methods.

#### Paging

You can get your results back in chunks. In order to set the page size and/or
the number of pages that you want to see, use the following query parameters:

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
page | Specifies which page of the results you want to see. Defaults to 1 (not 0).
per_page | The number of results you want to get back per request. The maximum value of this parameter is 100. Defaults to 100.

#### Sorting

You can sort the results you receive based on a field you specify. To specify
how you want the results to be sorted, append one or both of the following
query parameters to the request URL:

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
sort_by | The name of the field to sort by.  Valid values are `name`, `mediaCount`, `created`, or `updated`.  Defaults to sorting by Project ID.
sort_direction | Specifies the direction of the sort, defaults to '1'.  1 = ascending, 0 = descending.

For example, if you want to sort your results in *descending order* by the *date
created*, your request URL would look something like this:

<code class="full_width">https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects.json?sort_by=created&amp;sort_direction=0</code>


## Projects

**Projects** are the main organizational objects within Wistia.
Media must be stored within Projects.

### Methods

* [Projects#list](#projects_list)
* [Projects#show](#projects_show)
* [Projects#create](#projects_create)
* [Projects#update](#projects_update)
* [Projects#delete](#projects_delete)
* [Projects#copy](#projects_copy)

### Projects Response

When a Project Object is returned from a method, it will include the following
fields:

Field | Description
------|------------
id    | A unique numeric identifier for the project within the system.
name  | The project's display name.
description | The project's description.
mediaCount  | The number of different medias that have been uploaded to the project.
created   | The date that the project was originally created.
updated   | The date that the project was last updated.
hashedId  | A private hashed id, uniquely identifying the project within the system.
anonymousCanUpload  | A boolean indicating whether or not anonymous uploads are enabled for the project.
anonymousCanDownload  | A boolean indicating whether or not anonymous downloads are enabled for this project.
public  | A boolean indicating whether the project is available for public (anonymous) viewing.
publicId  | If the project is public, this field contains a string representing the ID used for referencing the project in public URLs.

### Projects: List

Use the Projects#list method to request a list of Projects in your Wistia 
account. This request supports [paging and sorting](#organizing_for_list_methods).

Projects#list requests look like this:

    GET https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects.json

#### Example Project#List Request

To retrieve all projects in an account, 10 projects at a time, starting on the
second page of results, then your request URL should look something like this:

    https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects.json?page=2&amp;per_page=10

#### The Response

{% codeblock json_example_response.json %}

### Projects: Show

Retrieve details about a specific project.

To get the details on a Project (and all media therein), send an HTTP **GET** request to the following URL:

    GET https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects/<project-hashed-id>.json

The response for the Projects#show request will also include an array of media
objects. Each entry in the media array has [all media object fields](#media_show).

### Project Sharings: Create

Share a project with a user by email. Conceptually, you do this by creating a 
new sharing object for a project.

<code class="full_width">
  POST https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects/&lt;project-id&gt;/sharings.json
</code>

This method can accept several parameters to customize the way that the sharing 
happens.

The only required parameter is **with**, which specifies the email address of 
the person with whom you want to share the project.

Parameter   | Description
------------|-------------------
with (required) | The email address of the person with whom you want to share the project.
requirePassword (optional)  | If this parameter is “1” (no quotes), which is the default value, then the user will be required to activate their account and set a password to see the project.  Set it to “0” (again, no quotes) to allow them to see the project without entering a password.
canShare (optional) | Set this parameter to “1” (no quotes) to allow the user to share the project with others.
canDownload (optional)  | Set this parameter to “1” (no quotes) to allow the user to download files from the project.
canUpload (optional)  | Set this parameter to “1” (no quotes) to allow the user to upload files to the project.
sendEmailNotification (optional) | Set this parameter to "1" (no quotes) to send a sharing notification on creation.


#### The Response

The server responds with `HTTP status 201 Created`, and the `Location` HTTP 
header is set to the API endpoint for the new sharing object.

The response body contains either a link for the user to activate their account
or a link for the user to access the project if they already have a 
username/password.

#### Example Project Sharings#create Request

**Status:** 201 Created<br/>
**Location:** https://api.wistia.com/v1/projects/13/sharings/16.json

{% codeblock example_json_response.json %}
{ "project": "http://myaccount.wistia.com/projects/13" }
{% endcodeblock %}

Here's an example of what the response body might look like if the user is not 
yet activated:

{% codeblock example_json_response.json %}
{ "activation": "http://myaccount.wistia.com/my_activation_link" }
{% endcodeblock %}

## Customizations

The Customize API lets you configure each video in your account with specific
customizations. These customizations will apply to your video both in your
account, and wherever you embed it.

The Customize API only responds with JSON. It expects data to be posted in JSON
format too.

### Customize API Methods

* [Customizations#show](#customizations_show)
* [Customizations#create](#customizations_create)
* [Customizations#update](#customizations_update)
* [Customizations#delete](#customizations_delete)

### Customizations: Show

The Customize API allows you to see the customizations saved for your video.

#### Request

In order to tell Wistia that you want information about a specific video, send
an HTTP GET request to the following URL:

<code class="full_width">https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias/<media-id>/customizations.json</code>

Make sure you replace `<media-id>` with the hashed ID of the video you want.

#### Response

Assuming authentication is successful and the request is in good order, the
HTTP response will contain JSON that describes explicitly defined
customizations for the video.

#### Example JSON Response

The embedding options are explained in the 
[Embedding Options Documentation]({{ '/embed-options' | post_url }}).

{% codeblock example_json_response.json %}
{
  "version":"v2",
  "playerColor":"ff0000",
  "stillUrl":"http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/1429609c45371f6b8549900a044055090824c1d5.bin",
  "autoPlay":"false",

    }
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

### Customizations: Create

The Customize API lets you replace the customizations for a video.

#### The Request

<code class="full_width">POST https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias/<media-id>/customizations.json</code>

Make sure you replace `<media-id>` with the hashed ID of the video that you
want to customize.

The raw post data is JSON representing the customizations that should be 
explicitly set for this video. These will replace the existing customizations 
for the video.

#### Example JSON Request

The embedding options are explained in the 
[Embedding Options Documentation]({{ '/embed-options' | post_url }}).

{% codeblock example_json_request.json %}
POST /medias/hxsvasanee/customizations.json HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Form Data:
{"playerColor":"ffffcc","controlsVisibleOnLoad":false}
{% endcodeblock %}

#### The Response

If the request is successful, the server will respond with a status of **201
Created**, along with the saved customizations.

Note that the saved customization values will all be strings. These are
dynamically casted to the proper type on the client side.

#### Example JSON Response

{% codeblock example_json_response.json %}
{
  "playerColor":"ffffcc",
  "controlsVisibleOnLoad":"false"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

### Customizations: Update

The Customize API allows you to do partial updates on a video's customizations.

#### The Request

<code class="full_width">PUT https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias/<media-id>/customizations.json</code>

Make sure you replace `<media-id>` with the hashed ID of the video you want to
customize.

The raw post data should be JSON representing the customizations that should be 
explicitly set for this video.

If a value is `null`, then that key will be deleted from the saved
customizations. If it is not `null`, that value will be set.

#### Example JSON Request

The embedding options are explained in the 
[Embedding Options Documentation]({{ '/embed-options' | post_url }}).

{% codeblock example_json_request.json %}
PUT /medias/hxsvasanee/customizations.json HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Form Data:
{
  "playerColor":"77dd77",
  "controlsVisibleOnLoad":null,
  "smallPlayButton":false
}
{% endcodeblock %}

#### The Response

If the media update is successful, the server will respond with a status of 
**200 OK**, along with the saved customizations.

Note that the saved customizations will all be strings. These are dynamically 
casted to the proper type on the client side.

#### Example JSON Response

{% codeblock example_json_response.json %}
{
  "playerColor":"77dd77",
  "smallPlayButton":"false"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

### Customizations: Delete

The Customize API allows you to delete a video's customizations.

#### The Request

<code class="full_width">DELETE https://api.wistia.com/v1/medias/<media-id>/customizations.json</code>

Make sure you replace `<media-id>` with the hashed ID of the media that you
want to delete.

This method will wipe out all explicit customizations for a video, and it will 
act like it has never been customized.

#### Example JSON Request

{% codeblock example_json_request.json %}
DELETE /medias/hxsvasanee/customizations.json HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{% endcodeblock %}

#### The Response

If the media update is successful, the server will respond with a status of 
200 OK.

## Asset URLs - Tips & Tricks


### Modifying File Extensions

Asset URLs in Wistia take this form:

    http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/43500c9644e43068d8995dcb5ddea82440419eaf.bin

The `.bin` extension at the URL is for binary. 
Certain ornery clients (iTunes, ahem) won't accept URLs that don't end in an
extension that's familiar to them.  In this case, you can drop the `.bin`, add
a slash, and append whatever filename and extension you like -– you'll still
get the underlying asset. So, say the URL above is an mp4 file and we _really_
want that in the URL. Here's what we'd have:

    http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/43500c9644e43068d8995dcb5ddea82440419eaf/my-file.mp4


### Resizing Images

Using the Data API or [oEmbed endpoint]({{ '/oembed' | post_url }}), you can obtain the thumbnail URL for your video, and then manipulate it. Check [working with images]({{ '/working-with-images' | post_url }}).


### Extracting Thumbnails

You can also extract thumbnails from a video by modify the URL of that video 
asset. Pretty sneaky, right? Here's how to do it: 
[Extracting Thumbnails]({{ '/extracting-thumbnails' | post_url }})
